                    This is the Information Technology age and at its core is Computer Science. Computer science involves the study and development of applications that allow for our everyday use of computers, the software systems that support these applications, and the means and methods used to produce both applications and systems that behave reliably, correctly and ethically.

                        The range of courses available in the department and the skills acquired by students enable them to find employment in many diverse fields of the economy and prepare our graduates for the computing industry, working in a project team (or research and development team), and to enable the graduate to bring specialist skills to that team.

                    The Department of Computer Science at the University of Ghana is a recognized leader in the creation of scientific knowledge and practical technologies that are defining this historic transformation. Our mission is to supply the people and ideas that will shape this new frontier.

                    The jobs of tomorrow will use technologies not yet invented. Many of the software and hardware tools that enable these technologies are being invented by our faculty and students. Such innovation requires dedication to learning, in the classroom, in the research laboratory, and throughout one's professional career.
